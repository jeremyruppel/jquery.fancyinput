jQuery fancyinput plugin
========================

About
-----

**jquery.fancyinput** is a quick little plugin for styling file input fields. 
The technique was inspired heavily from [this blog post by David](http://blog.vworld.at/2008/08/21/styling-an-input-typefile-using-jquery/).

Usage
-----
	
	$( 'input[type=file]' ).fancyinput( '<a class="my-new-button">Upload yer filez!</a>' );

See the test/index.html page for a working demo.

Caveats
-------

This plugin really hasn't been tested. At all. Maybe I'll get around to testing it sometime, but it really doesn't do that much.
